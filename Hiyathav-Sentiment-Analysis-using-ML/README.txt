This is a Flask web application that uses Scikit-learn and VADER Sentiment to create a machine-learning sentiment analysis model. The project utilizes several libraries, including Flask, Sklearn, Requests, NLTK, RE, and vaderSentiment.

VADER Sentiment is a sentiment analysis tool that is focused on sentiments expressed in social media and is based on a lexicon and rule-based system. It works well on texts from various domains.

Sentiment analysis is a crucial area in Natural Language Processing that automatically detects affective states of text. It is widely used in analyzing voice-of-customer materials such as product reviews on online shopping websites and social media. Sentiment analysis can classify the polarity of a text as positive or negative or go beyond polarity, looking at sentiment states, etc.

Analyzing an opinion or feelings about something using data like text or images is called sentiment analysis, and it helps companies in their decision-making process. For instance, if public sentiment toward a product is poor, a company may modify the product or stop production altogether to avoid losses.

Public sentiment can be sourced from various channels such as public interviews, opinion polls, surveys, etc. However, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are increasingly becoming popular for parsing public sentiment.

The output of this application looks like a GIF that displays the sentiment analysis results.
